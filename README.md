## Fixing errors

If you encounter `No results found` (and are sure the prompt was correct) or any breaking issue, then make sure you are on **latest version** by typing
`sudo ani-cli -U` to update on Linux, Mac and Android. On Windows, run `ani-cli -U`.
If after this the issue persists then open an issue.

## Install

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/ani-cli.svg?minversion=4.0)](https://repology.org/project/ani-cli/versions)

### Tier 1 Support: Linux, Mac, Android

*These Platforms have rock solid support and are used by maintainers and large parts of the userbase.*

<details><summary><b>Linux</b></summary>

#### Native Packages

*Native packages have a more robust update cycle, but sometimes they are slow to upgrade. \
If the one for your platform is up-to-date we suggest going with it.*

<details><summary>Debian 13/unstable</summary>

```sh
sudo apt install ani-cli
```
</details>

<details><summary>Fedora</summary>

To install mpv (and vlc) you need _RPM Fusion free_ enabled. Simply follow the instructions here: https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration
To be able to install syncplay, you'll need to enable this copr repo (instructions included): https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/batmanfeynman/syncplay/.

To install ani-cli:
```sh
sudo dnf copr enable derisis13/ani-cli
sudo dnf install ani-cli
```
*If for your distro uses rpm and you would like to see a native package, open an issue.*

</details><details><summary>Arch</summary>

Build and install from the AUR:
```sh
yay -S ani-cli
```
Also consider `ani-cli-git`

</details><details><summary>Gentoo</summary>

Build and install from the GURU:
```sh
sudo eselect repository enable guru
sudo emaint sync -r guru
sudo emerge -a ani-cli
```
Consider using the 9999 ebuild.
```sh
sudo emerge -a =app-misc/ani-cli-9999
```

</details><details><summary>OpenSuse</summary>

On Suse the provided MPV and VLC packages are missing features that are used by ani-cli. The only required is the "Only Essentials" repository which has versions for each Suse release.
You can find instructions on this [here](https://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories#Packman).

To add the ani-cli copr repo, update then install ani-cli run (on both versions):
```sh
zypper addrepo https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/derisis13/ani-cli/opensuse-tumbleweed-x86_64/ ani-cli
zypper dup
zypper install ani-cli
```
You'll get a warning about `Signature verification failed [4-Signatures public key is not available]` but this can be ignored from the prompt.

*Note: package is noarch, so any architecture should work, even though the repo is labelled x86-64*

</details></details><details><summary><b>MacOS</b></summary>

Install dependencies [(See below)](#dependencies-1)

Install [HomeBrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) if not installed.

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli.git" && cd ./ani-cli
cp ./ani-cli "$(brew --prefix)"/bin
cd .. && rm -rf ./ani-cli
```

*To install (with Homebrew) the dependencies required on Mac OS, you can run:*

```sh
brew install curl grep aria2 ffmpeg git fzf yt-dlp && \
brew install --cask iina
```
*Why iina and not mpv? Drop-in replacement for mpv for MacOS. Integrates well with OSX UI. Excellent support for M1. Open Source.*

</details><details><summary><b>Android</b></summary>

Install termux [(Guide)](https://termux.com/)

#### Termux package

```sh
pkg up -y
pkg install ani-cli
```
If you're using Android 14 make sure to run this due to [#1206](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli/issues/1206):
```sh
pkg install termux-am
```

For players you can use the apk (playstore/fdroid) versions of mpv and vlc. Note that these cannot be checked from termux so a warning is generated when checking dependencies.

</details>

### Tier 2 Support: Windows, WSL, iOS, Steam Deck, FreeBSD

*While officially supported (except FreeBSD), installation is more involved on these platforms and sometimes issues arise. \
Reach out if you need help.*

<details><summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

`ani-cli` is on scoop. Please read further for setup instructions.

We will set up the bash.exe that comes with Git for Windows to be used with Windows Terminal. You may use terminals such as Wezterm or Alacritty, but this guide only covers Windows Terminal. The Git Bash terminal (i.e., mintty) [has problems with fzf](#windows-known-problems-and-solutions).

First, you'll need to install the scoop package manager. [(Install)](https://scoop.sh/) Follow **quickstart**.

Next, get Windows Terminal. It comes preinstalled on Windows 11. If you do not have it, install it by running the following commands in powershell.

```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/windows-terminal
```

Next, get git. If you have it, please update it. If you do not already have it, install it by running `scoop install git` in powershell.

Ensure that Git Bash is present in the Windows Terminal tab drop down, as shown below.

![windows-terminal-git-bash-1.png](.assets/windows-terminal-git-bash-1.png)

If it is not there, please add it. To add it, first click the drop-down button beside the new tab button (shown above).

Then, navigate to `Settings > Profiles > Add a new profile`. Click `+ New empty profile`.

![windows-terminal-git-bash-2.png](.assets/windows-terminal-git-bash-2.png)

Next:
- If you installed git with scoop: Set *Name* as "Git Bash", set *Command line* as `%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\bin\bash.exe -i -l`, and set *Icon* as `%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\mingw64\share\git\git-for-windows.ico`.
- If you installed git by other means: Set *Name* as "Git Bash", set *Command line* as `C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe -i -l`, and set *Icon* as `C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\share\git\git-for-windows.ico`.

Next, set *Starting Directory* to `%USERPROFILE%`, and ensure that *Hide profile from dropdown* is set to "Off" (otherwise you won't be able to see this profile in the drop down).

![windows-terminal-git-bash-3.png](.assets/windows-terminal-git-bash-3.png)

Now save your changes.

You will use this profile to run `ani-cli` in this bash shell.
Under Startup in Windows Terminal Settings, you may set this profile as the default so that you do not have to switch to it every time you want to run `ani-cli`.

![windows-terminal-git-bash-4.png](.assets/windows-terminal-git-bash-4.png)

Now restart Windows Terminal. In the Git Bash profile, install `ani-cli` by running the following commands.

```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install extras/windows-terminal
```

Next, install its dependencies.

```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install fzf ffmpeg mpv
```

Consider also installing `yt-dlp` and `aria2` for downloading to work.

Restart Windows Terminal. Go to the Git Bash profile and update `ani-cli` with `ani-cli -U`. You will use this keep ani-cli up-to-date.

Now you can use ani-cli. Read the output of `ani-cli -h` for more help.

#### Windows: Known Problems and Solutions

If you have a problem, please update ani-cli to the latest version with `ani-cli -U`. If you still have a problem, please read further.

- Stuck in "Search anime:". This shouldn't happen if you are using the Windows Terminal + Bash setup described above. It happens if you are using the Git Bash terminal (i.e., the mintty terminal). This is a problem between fzf and mintty, which should be resolved in future versions of fzf. For the time being, either use the Windows Terminal setup described above or, if you are dead-set on using the mintty terminal, run `export MSYS=enable_pcon` before running ani-cli.
- "No such file or directory" or WSL-related errors: This shouldn't happen if you are using the Window Terminal + Bash setup described above. This happens if you run ani-cli in powershell or cmd. This is due WSL's bash.exe being called instead of Git for Windows' bash.exe in `%USERPROFILE%\scoop\shims\ani-cli.cmd`. If you must use powershell or cmd, edit the `%USERPROFILE%\scoop\shims\ani-cli.cmd` file. In File Explorer, go to the `C:\Users\USERNAME\scoop\shims` directory and open the `ani-cli.cmd` file with notepad. Next:
    - If you installed git with scoop, replace `@bash` with `@"%GIT_INSTALL_ROOT%\bin\bash.exe"`, or
    - If you installed git by other means, replace `@bash` with `@"C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe"`.
This should be fixed if the ani-cli scoop manifest gets updated in [this PR](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/pull/13342).
- curl can cause issues. ani-cli has been tested unsuccessfully with curl `7.83.1` and successfully with `7.86.0`. If you run into issues, try installing a newer one with scoop.
- If you installed mpv with scoop, your mpv configuration will get read from `C:\Users\USERNAME\scoop\apps\mpv\current\portable_config`. See [the mpv documentation](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/) regarding `portable_config` for more details.

</details><details><summary><b>WSL</b></summary>

Follow the installation instructions of your Linux distribution.

Note that the media player (mpv or vlc) will need to be installed on Windows, not WSL. See the justification for this in the comment [(here)](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli/issues/1266#issuecomment-1926945757). Instructions on how to use the media player from WSL instead are also included in the linked comment.

When installing the media player on Windows, make sure that it is on the Windows Path. An easy way to ensure this is to download the media player with a package manager (on Windows, not WSL) such as scoop.

</details><details><summary><b>iOS</b></summary>

Install iSH and VLC from the app store.

Make sure apk is updated using
```apk update; apk upgrade```
then run this:
```sh
apk add grep sed curl fzf git aria2 ncurses
apk add ffmpeg
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli ~/.ani-cli
cp ~/.ani-cli/ani-cli /usr/local/bin/ani-cli
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ani-cli
rm -rf ~/.ani-cli
```
note that downloading is going to be very slow. This is an iSH issue, not an ani-cli issue.
</details>

### Ani-Skip

Ani-skip is a script to automatically skip anime opening sequences, making it easier to watch your favorite shows without having to manually skip the intros each time (from the original [README](https://github.com/synacktraa/ani-skip/tree/master#a-script-to-automatically-skip-anime-opening-sequences-making-it-easier-to-watch-your-favorite-shows-without-having-to-manually-skip-the-intros-each-time)).

For install instructions visit [ani-skip](https://github.com/synacktraa/ani-skip).

Ani-skip uses the external lua script function of mpv and as such – for now – only works with mpv.

**Warning:** For now, ani-skip does **not** seem to work under Windows.

**Note:** It may be, that ani-skip won't know the anime you're trying to watch. Try using the `--skip-title <title>` command line argument. (It uses the [aniskip API](https://github.com/lexesjan/typescript-aniskip-extension/tree/main/src/api/aniskip-http-client) and you can contribute missing anime or ask for including it in the database on their [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UqT55CbrbE)).
