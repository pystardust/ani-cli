## Fixing errors

If you encounter `No results found` (and are sure the prompt was correct) or any breaking issue, then make sure you are on **latest version** by typing
`sudo ani-cli -U` to update on Linux, Mac and Android. On Windows, run windows terminal preview and there type `ani-cli -U`.
If after this the issue persists then open an issue.

## Install

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/ani-cli.svg?minversion=4.0)](https://repology.org/project/ani-cli/versions)

### Tier 1 Support: Linux, Mac, Android

*These Platforms have rock solid support and are used by maintainers and large parts of the userbase.*

<details><summary><b>Linux</b></summary>

#### Native Packages

*Native packages have a more robust update cycle, but sometimes they are slow to upgrade. \
If the one for your platform is up-to-date we suggest going with it.*

<details><summary>Debian 13/unstable</summary>

```sh
sudo apt install ani-cli
```
</details>

<details><summary>Fedora</summary>

To install mpv (and vlc) you need _RPM Fusion free_ enabled. Simply follow the instructions here: https://rpmfusion.org/Configuration
To be able to install syncplay, you'll need to enable this copr repo (instructions included): https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/batmanfeynman/syncplay/.

To install ani-cli:
```sh
sudo dnf copr enable derisis13/ani-cli
sudo dnf install ani-cli
```
*If for your distro uses rpm and you would like to see a native package, open an issue.*

</details><details><summary>Arch</summary>

Build and install from the AUR:
```sh
yay -S ani-cli
```
Also consider `ani-cli-git`

</details><details><summary>Gentoo</summary>

Build and install from the GURU:
```sh
sudo eselect repository enable guru
sudo emaint sync -r guru
sudo emerge -a ani-cli
```
Consider using the 9999 ebuild.
```sh
sudo emerge -a =app-misc/ani-cli-9999
```

</details><details><summary>OpenSuse</summary>

On Suse the provided MPV and VLC packages are missing features that are used by ani-cli. The only required is the "Only Essentials" repository which has versions for each Suse release.
You can find instructions on this [here](https://en.opensuse.org/Additional_package_repositories#Packman).

To add the ani-cli copr repo, update then install ani-cli run (on both versions):
```sh
zypper addrepo https://download.copr.fedorainfracloud.org/results/derisis13/ani-cli/opensuse-tumbleweed-x86_64/ ani-cli
zypper dup
zypper install ani-cli
```
You'll get a warning about `Signature verification failed [4-Signatures public key is not available]` but this can be ignored from the prompt.

*Note: package is noarch, so any architecture should work, even though the repo is labelled x86-64*

</details></details><details><summary><b>MacOS</b></summary>

Install dependencies [(See below)](#dependencies-1)

Install [HomeBrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation) if not installed.

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli.git" && cd ./ani-cli
cp ./ani-cli "$(brew --prefix)"/bin
cd .. && rm -rf ./ani-cli
```

*To install (with Homebrew) the dependencies required on Mac OS, you can run:*

```sh
brew install curl grep aria2 ffmpeg git fzf yt-dlp && \
brew install --cask iina
```
*Why iina and not mpv? Drop-in replacement for mpv for MacOS. Integrates well with OSX UI. Excellent support for M1. Open Source.*

</details><details><summary><b>Android</b></summary>

Install termux [(Guide)](https://termux.com/)

#### Termux package

```sh
pkg up -y
pkg install ani-cli
```
If you're using Android 14 make sure to run this due to [#1206](https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli/issues/1206):
```sh
pkg install termux-am
```

For players you can use the apk (playstore/fdroid) versions of mpv and vlc. Note that these cannot be checked from termux so a warning is generated when checking dependencies.

</details>

### Tier 2 Support: Windows, iOS, Steam Deck

*While officially supported, installation is more involved on these platforms and sometimes issues arise. \
Reach out if you need help.*

<details><summary><b>Windows</b></summary>

First, you'll need windows terminal preview. [(Install)](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal-preview/9N8G5RFZ9XK3?hl=en-us&gl=US) It comes preinstalled with Windows 11

Then, install scoop. You will use this to install and update ani-cli from time to time. [(Install)](https://scoop.sh/) Follow **quickstart**.

```sh
scoop bucket add extras
scoop install ani-cli fzf mpv git
```
Consider also installing `yt-dlp` and `aria2` for downloading to work

#### Dependencies

All dependencies can be installed with scoop (from the extras bucket), however some users experienced that installed programs aren't always added to the path. If this happens installing from winget instead usually works.

Note that curl can cause issues.
ani-cli has been tested unsuccessfully with curl `7.83.1` and successfully with `7.86.0`.
If you run into issues, try the scoop install or grab the newest curl you can find.

</details><details><summary><b>iOS</b></summary>

Install iSH and VLC from the app store.

Make sure apk is updated using
```apk update; apk upgrade```
then run this:
```sh
apk add grep sed curl fzf git aria2 ncurses
apk add ffmpeg
git clone https://github.com/pystardust/ani-cli ~/.ani-cli
cp ~/.ani-cli/ani-cli /usr/local/bin/ani-cli
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ani-cli
rm -rf ~/.ani-cli
```
note that downloading is going to be very slow. This is an iSH issue, not an ani-cli issue.
</details>

<details><summary><b>Steam Deck</b></summary>

#### Copypaste script:

* Switch to Desktop mode (`STEAM` Button > Power > Switch to Desktop)
* Open `Konsole` (Steam Deck Icon in bottom left corner > System > Konsole)
* Copy the script, paste it in the CLI and press Enter("A" button on Steam Deck)

### Ani-Skip

Ani-skip is a script to automatically skip anime opening sequences, making it easier to watch your favorite shows without having to manually skip the intros each time (from the original [README](https://github.com/synacktraa/ani-skip/tree/master#a-script-to-automatically-skip-anime-opening-sequences-making-it-easier-to-watch-your-favorite-shows-without-having-to-manually-skip-the-intros-each-time)).

For install instructions visit [ani-skip](https://github.com/synacktraa/ani-skip).

Ani-skip uses the external lua script function of mpv and as such – for now – only works with mpv.

**Warning:** For now, ani-skip does **not** seem to work under Windows.

**Note:** It may be, that ani-skip won't know the anime you're trying to watch. Try using the `--skip-title <title>` command line argument. (It uses the [aniskip API](https://github.com/lexesjan/typescript-aniskip-extension/tree/main/src/api/aniskip-http-client) and you can contribute missing anime or ask for including it in the database on their [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/UqT55CbrbE)).
